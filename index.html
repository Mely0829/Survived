  <p>Hi, I am Thomas Jenkins, an enthusiastic and committed Engineer with almost three years’ experience, who in February 2018 awoke in hospital from an <strong>induced coma after a sudden cardiac arrest</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    My experience in living with a cardiac arrhythmia and an <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/arrhythmia/prevention--treatment-of-arrhythmia/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator-icd">Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) </a>
    compels me to apply my training as an Electrical and Electronic Engineer to extend the battery life of ICDs for which there is strong
    expertise within Oxford's Energy and Power Group (EPG).
  </p>
  <h3><em>How have I survived the odds?</em></h3>

    <li>I understood that everything has a purpose.</li>
    <li>Trust life, trust fate, trust until it seems ridiculous.</li>
  </ul>
